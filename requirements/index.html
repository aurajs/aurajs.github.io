<h2>What does Aura rely on?</h2>

<ul>
<li>A Promise/A implementation</li>
<li>and AMD loader</li>
<li>a small subset of underscore (because coding without it sucks)</li>
<li>an eventemitter implementation</li>
<li>a selector engine</li>
</ul>

<p>As per the current version, the following implementations are provided with Aura:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Promise/A</strong>: <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/">jQuery Deferred</a>, but <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q">Q</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js">rsvp.js</a> are great options.</li>
<li><strong>AMD</strong>: <a href="http://requirejs.org">requirejs</a>, but it would be nice to test other ones (curl.js for example which is much smaller).</li>
<li><strong>underscore</strong>: we could make a minimal build of <a href="http://lodash.org">lodash</a> and distribute it with aura.</li>
<li><strong>eventemitter</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/hij1nx/EventEmitter2">eventEmitter2</a>, for the moment. we could also have a look at <a href="https://github.com/postaljs/postal.js">postal.js</a> which is extensible and may suit more our needs.</li>
<li><strong>selector engine</strong>: Currently <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> required by the components extension, which is always included for the moment; but we don&#39;t really have to.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Minimum requirements</h2>

<p>Aura should work everywhere. Aura itself is really tiny!
Although we recommend using the latest possible browser for your computer, you&#39;ll always get a better experience.</p>

<p>For the moment the <code>platform.js</code> file is a collection of polyfills for older browsers, but it does not really scale...
Including more featureful polyfills like <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim">es5-shim</a> is a possibility but the goal was to keep Aura as small as possible.</p>

<p>We should have a way to CI on several browsers...</p>
