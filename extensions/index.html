<h2>Aura Core extensions</h2>

<h3>Debug</h3>

<p>debug extension to provide feedback to the developers.
if app.config.debug = true then debug is activated.</p>

<ul>
<li>what tools are here? loggers? read eval print loop?</li>
<li>are they cross-browser compatible? to what version?</li>
</ul>

<p>For the moment... nothing much here, but we should provide strong debugging tools
here</p>

<h3>Mediator</h3>

<p>App pubsub / mediator pattern. Provides a central point of communication... blablabla</p>

<ul>
<li>this is the pubsub?</li>
</ul>

<p>yep, very minimal for the moment too...
came accross postal.js which seems an interesting candidate to replace ee2 (smaller, more modular...).</p>

<p>An other idea to have a rich api on top of the mediator, would be to have a middleware stack around it
It would allow us to implement the permissions system as a middleware for example.</p>

<ul>
<li>can does mediator handle any other functionality other than pubsub?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Components</h3>
